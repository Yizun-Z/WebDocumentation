			<h2>Reflection on Proposal</h2>
			<p>In the previous<a href="proposal.html" target="_blank"> proposal</a>, I conducted lots of background and user research
				to figure out my <a href="proposal.html#target audience" target="_blank">target audience</a> and the <a href="proposal.html#concept"
				 target="_blank">main concept</a> of my website. Based on these, I iterated my ideas and made the final <a href="proposal.html#mockups"
				 target="_blank">mock-ups</a> , which received quite good feedback from both my tutor and my peers, and I was satisfied
				with the design choice I did as well. Thus, the most challengeable things for me was to overcome technical problems and
				implement all of the designs into the real website, which as close as possible to mock-ups. During this process, I also
				conducted along with self-reflection and refinements, which was demonstrated as below: </p>

			<h4> Homepage</h4>

      <blockquote>
        In order to resonate strongly with the viewers at the beginning, this website will display the serious impact of bushfire 2020 which everyone familiar with. This photo gives people a great shock from a visual point of view, then make people understand firstly how much these animals need help. To strengthen this effect, I decide to remove the down-arrow on this page to make this photo bigger. Meanwhile, the colour theme I choose is to match with this photo, on the one hand, to fit the tone of dreariness as well. 
      </blockquote>
  
      <img src="screenshot/news.png" alt="placeholder image" width="100%"/>
      <blockquote>
        This part aims to continuously provide feedback for our donors, which will certify all of the actions conducted by this organisation are authentic, meaningful and have a great impact on local wildlife and nature. 
        What’s more, based on users feedback, I have changed left and right switch button to a drop-down arrow, because most of the typography for this website was designed to browse vertically, except this horizontally browse option. Thus, this refinement will keep the conveniency and consistency for scanning news and blog.

        <figcaption>This is the mock-up of mobile version.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
			  <img src="screenshot/mobile_1.png" alt="placeholder image" width="100%"/>
        <figcaption>This is the final version of mobile screen.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <blockquote>It seems limited to change to another photo by the responsive CSS method without Javascript. Thus, in the end, I made a responsive screen like below for the mobile device. Due to this tiny problem, the homepage part is not as good as mock-ups, but the ‘news & blog’ part runs pretty well through a responsive CSS way.</blockquote>

      <h4> "Cloud pets" page</h4>
			<figure>
			  <img src="docs/cloud pets.jpg" alt="placeholder image" width="100%"/>
        <figcaption>This is a mockup for cloud pets page.</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <img src="screenshot/cloud pets.png" alt="placeholder image" width="100%"/>
        <figcaption>This is a wireframe for mobile.</figcaption>
        </figure> 
        <blockquote>For content part, this page contains one of the most important features for this website which is providing a special connect with such cute wildlife. People can not only donate to help them, but also adopt them online via this website. Donors can have a video link with their adopted animal, and watch them, feed them, even interact with them by video. It is very meaningful for people to experience the whole process of helping wildlife rehabilitate from great trauma in a bushfire. For the design part, I was satisfied with the layout shown in mock-ups. But in order to keep the consistency of card-like poster in ‘News’ part and vertical reading style, I rearranged the layout of each part and using “down-arrow” sign instead of the button, which was consistent and tidy for looking. </blockquote>

      <figure>
        <img src="mock-up/cloud_phone.png" alt="placeholder image" width="200px"/>
        <figcaption>This is the mock-up of mobile version.</figcaption>
			  <img src="screenshot/mobile_4.jpg" alt="placeholder image" width="100%"/>
        <figcaption>This is the final version of mobile screen.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <blockquote>Vertical card-like poster run quite well through CSS responsive on the mobile screen size. Meanwhile, the portraits of animals are dominant on the screen. This kind of element placement will emphasis wildlife and obtain more attention as well. </blockquote>
